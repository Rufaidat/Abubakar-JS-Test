#test 1
the function median takes two arrays as parameters and assign the the values of both arrays copied with the spread operator to a new array(arr). 
the array arr is sorted in ascending order with the modified javascript built in sort method.
to get the median an if/else chain is created which returns the mid value of arr if arr.length is an odd number and returns the average of both 
mid numbers if arr.length is an even number.

#test 2
the function romanNumerals convert integers to its roman numeral equivalent.
it does this by;
1. taking an integer as parameter
2. looks through content of the object romanNum which contains the roman numerals main keys
3. instantiate a romanNumerals variable which will be returned from the function
4. looks through the value of every entries of romanNum with a for in loop, if num is greater than or equals to any of the keys value it concats the key to 
the romanNumeral string and subtract the value from num and the process is repeated until num is lesser than 1

#test 3
the function mergeAndSort takes two arrays as parameters and assign the the values of both arrays copied with the spread operator to a new array(arr). 
the array arr is sorted in ascending order with the modified javascript built in sort method and returned.
